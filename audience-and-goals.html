						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After conducting preliminary research, we determined who our audiences were and the goals applicable to those audiences.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Audience</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>In order to make the website redesign as effective and efficient as possible, the next step was to figure out who the target audiences were for the site. We started by using upside-down triangle thinking: start broad and then work towards specifics.</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/img-15.png" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>First, I recognized what the three main goals I believe Slow Food Upstate communicated. I did not establish these goals so that I could match them to my audience, but they served as more of loose guidlines and overarching categories.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/img-13.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>After determining those broad goals, I made categories: <i>Audience (as an Organization)</i>, <i>Audience (Consumers/Earth Market)</i>, <i>Sponsors</i>, <i>Partners</i>, and <i>Skeptics</i>. I then proceded to fit a wide range and variety of audiences into each category.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/img-9.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>I soon found that there were some audiences that fit into multiple categories. I wanted to cover all my bases, so I wedged them between columns to show interchangability. It was hard narrowing them down even further and deciding which section of the determined audience would fit best.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/img-9edit.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>When it came down to refining my audience in this exercise, I focused on the categories <i>Audience (as an Organization)</i> and <i>Audience (Consumers/Earth Market)</i>. I found that these two categories directly represented the main audience I wanted to reach.</p></div>
					</div>
					<p>Once the audience for the organization were specified, we could start defining applicable goals.</p>

				<h3>Conclusion and Final Thoughts</h3>
				<p>The primary overarching goals of the Slow Food Upstate website redesign is to boost membership, clarify the organization's mission and provide events/event information for the public.</p>
				<p>Preliminary research of Slow Food Upstate - both primary and secondary - was much more helpful than I would have thought. This portion of the research was conducted before the interviews, so having a foundation of in-depth research about the organization really helped in defining goals and audiences.
