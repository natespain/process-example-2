						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p class="info">Using a worksheet from the Human Centered Design Toolkit, we determined what our design challenge would be for the non-profit we chose.</p>

					<h3>What is the problen you're trying to solve?</h3>
						<p>How can the Slow Food Upstate website help educate people and businesses about healthy food alternatives?</p>
						<h3>Now, state the ultimate impact you're trying to have.</h3>
						<p>To help farmers and consumers alike learn about the "slow food" movement and offer resources for them to share and buy.</p>
						<h3>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h3>
						<p>Hierarchy, clear and concise information, more visible volunteer and membership options, and overall cleaner site navigation.</p>
						<h3>Finally, write down some of the content and constraints that you're facing.</h3>
						<p>Some demographics are too busy to stop and learn about slow food/buy from local farmers; food markets generally end in the late fall; the website needs to be navigable for the older demographic.</p>
						<h3>Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</h3>
						<p>How can the Slow Food Upstate website target a varied demographic (some with fast-paced lifestyles) in order to educate them about how to grow and sell/where to buy healthier food options?</p>
						<hr>
						<p>The Design Challenge was helpful in directing my focus. With an action-based question, I was able to better determine what I should concentrate on during the redesign process to create a more effective website.</p>
